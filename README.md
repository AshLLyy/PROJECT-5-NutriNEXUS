# PROJECT-5-NutriNEXUS
NutriNEXUS: Your Personalized Nutrition Companion

This project is about combination between RAG CHatbox and computer visual AI in healthy food field using classification method. 

NUTRINexus Bot is a smart, interactive nutrition assistant designed to provide personalized dietary guidance and support. It analyzes individual preferences, and goals to create tailored meal plans, suggest healthy recipes, and classify the food is healthy or unhealthy. NutriNexus promotes better nutrition habits, helps manage weight, improves overall well-being, and addresses specific needs like diabetes or heart health.
With real-time advice, reminders, and motivation, NutriNexus empowers users to make informed food choices and achieve long-term health goals.

This project need to improve more in many aspect. For example, from the method use, labeling the picture and size of the dataset need to add more. Other than that, the dataset need to have many variance of food for model to train more. This project need to change the method to apply Computer Visual and Chatbox with Object detection. To improve this project, I need to use  laptop specifications that meet the requirements to train the model with large of dataset.
